# Machine learning biotite thermometer
This repository contains the single-crystal biotite thermometer presented in "Calibration, validation, and evaluation of machine learning thermobarometers in metamorphic petrology: an application to biotite and outlook for future strategy" by Hartmeier et al. (2025).

# Installation

To use the thermometer you can download this repository (or ```git clone https://github.com/Philipsite/ml-biotite-thermobarometry.git```) into any directory on your machine.

The machine learning biotite thermometer requires Python `>3.10`.

Once downloaded (or cloned), open a terminal and navigate into the directory.
```
cd <PATH_NAME/ml-bt-thermometer
```
Run the installation script [install.sh](install.zsh) to install all required dependencies:
```
chmod +x install.zsh
./install.zsh
```

# Usage

The machine learning thermometer comes as interactive [jupyter notebook](ml_bt_thermometer.ipynb). If you have no previous experience with jupyter notebook, run [run.sh](run.zsh) to start up the notebook:
```
chmod +x run.zsh
./run.zsh
```
